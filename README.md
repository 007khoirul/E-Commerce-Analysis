1. Sales Discrepancy between Web and Mobile: The significant difference in sales between Web and Mobile platforms, even though the means are similar, suggests potential seasonality or periodicity in sales data. To capitalize on this trend, consider launching platform-specific promotions or optimizing the user experience for each platform to maximize sales potential.

2. Member Login Types: The prevalence of "Member" login types indicates a strong appreciation among customers for account-related benefits. To further leverage this trend, continue enhancing the features and benefits of member accounts, such as personalized recommendations and loyalty programs, to encourage more customers to create accounts.

3. Sales Trends by Month and Day: Sales peaking in November, May, and July, along with higher sales on Tuesdays, suggests that certain times of the year and days of the week are more favorable for sales. Plan marketing campaigns and promotions around these peak times to maximize sales revenue.
   
4. Top Selling Products and Categories: Identify top-selling products and categories to focus marketing efforts and inventory management. Ensure that these products remain well-stocked and consider bundling or cross-promoting related items to increase average order value.

5. Order Aging and Sales: Recognize that longer order fulfillment times (up to day 6) may negatively impact sales. Strive to optimize order processing and fulfillment to meet customer expectations and improve sales conversion rates.
   
6. Discounts and Sales: Capitalize on the observed positive correlation between discounts and sales. Consider strategic discounting strategies, such as offering targeted discounts on high-margin products or during peak sales periods, to drive revenue growth.
   
7. Preferred Payment Methods: Acknowledge that customers prefer credit cards, followed by money orders, e-wallets, and debit cards. Ensure that your payment processing infrastructure is robust, secure, and capable of accommodating these preferred payment methods to enhance the overall shopping experience.

8. Order Priority and Delivery Speed: Recognize that customers selecting "Critical" order priority expect rapid delivery and that this expectation is being met. Evaluate whether there are opportunities to further expedite deliveries for critical orders. For "Low" priority orders, consider communication strategies that manage customer expectations regarding longer delivery times.

9. Consider tailoring marketing and product offerings to target male customers more effectively in the auto and accessories and fashion product categories.
